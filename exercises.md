WEEK 1

Class expectations:

- To learn about different forms of digital writing and how it challenges/differs from print.
- What exactly draws the line between digital writing and writing that is just published online?.
- How digital writing pre-dates the internet and computers.
- To learn about how you can experiment with digital writing as a form of narrative and storytelling, and how it’s useful as a writer.


What types of writing do you do (eg. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

- Prose fiction and non-fiction, screenwriting, editorial/journalism.

What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- Pen and paper occasionally (more for brainstorming/random thoughts), computer, Google Docs, Notes on phone, Final Draft, Emaki (which is like Wordpress), hyperlinks, images, fonts, formatting, and sometimes videos.

Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Programs like Google Docs are user friendly, and keep all your work in one place that can be easily accessed and saved from any device. I add elements like links, photos and videos to give what I’m writing more context and to support whatever it is I’m writing. Programs like Final Draft are industry standard and commonly used. 

How do these tools shape the way you write (eg. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- It gives me more freedom to type online rather than writing on paper, because you can delete, make duplicate copies, and play around with different elements. These tools also shape the way I use form in my writing, allowing me to play around with images, hypertext, fonts, special effects, and other aesthetic elements. These are limited on print.

EXPERIENCE PLAYING SHADE:

I found the experience of playing Shade to be very frustrating. I myself am generally not a fan of this form of interactive fiction, as I prefer visuals and audio to keep me engaged. I think the idea and premise is quite clever, but there is something I find off-putting about written code that you can’t work your way out of. It’s annoying when you keep getting the same answer, or the program can’t compute what you’ve typed, and it feels like you’ve hit a brick wall. I have a short attention-span, so I didn’t get too far into Shade, and I don’t have a desire to revisit and finish it. 


WEEK 2

Electronic Literature Examples/Case Studies

The Sweet Old Etcetera - Alison Clifford

- ‘The Sweet Old Etcetera’ is a piece of digital literature by Alison Clifford. It consists of several different poems, the first one appearing in the shape of a tree. By clicking on different words that the branches are made up of, several other words pop up on the screen, and the reader must click on words and characters to make new words appear to fully form the poem. While this was a visually striking idea and quite compelling to interact with, I felt that the format and appearance took away from the actual content. I wasn’t actually reading any of the poetry because I was too interested in clicking on different things and making new things appear and move around. Also, everything appears quite messy on the screen, and words are almost scrambled, so it’s hard to actually fully engage with any of the poetry because you are struggling to coherently put sentences together as letters dance around the page and move around before making it to their final destination.

Asking for the Moon: Working Nights in Waikiki - John David Zuern

- ‘Asking for the Moon: Working Nights in Waikiki’ is a piece of digital literature by John David Zeurn, which takes the form of an electronic poem aided by visuals. The poem evokes imagery and atmosphere associated with the high-rise hotels which line the shores of Waikiki in Honolulu, Hawaii. It relies on visual timing, with lines of poetry appearing and disappearing after a second, forcing the reader to keep up with the flower, as well as the changing images of the skyline on screen. I found the poem effective but fleeting, as I was not able to go back and read lines again, or sometimes I would completely miss lines because of the speed with which the lines appear and disappear. It was difficult to completely take in.

Everything Is Going to Be Okay - Nathalie Lawhead 

- ‘Everything Is Going to Be Okay’ is a piece of digital literature by Nathalie Lawhead, taking the form of a computer desktop application. It features vignettes, images, videos, audio, music, animation and interactive features that explore themes around mental health. It relies on interactive features, such as readers clicking pop ups and icons, to present its content and activate different code and writing. Clicking on these pop ups pushes you forward into the piece of work, giving the reader access to more and more content as you go along. The application emulates your computer glitching as you click through and explore its different components, which is an effect that would nearly be nowhere as immersive on print. Having the glitching visuals on an actual computer screen and not on print makes it more realistic and unnerving, playing into those ideas of your thoughts being out of control. It features lots of little animations and characters that you can even control with your keyboard, which completely relies on its electronic format. This is a unique form of literature that utilises technology and online tools to create a deep sensory experience, which would only be possible in this form.  

C-ya-laterrrr - Dan Hett

- ‘C-ya-laterrr’ is a piece of digital literature by Dan Hett. It is both a recollection and events and series of thought processes, based on the author’s experience losing his brother during the 2017 Ariana Grande concert terror attack in Manchester. The piece chronicles the night of the attack up until the weeks that follow, particularly focusing on grief and derealisation. Hett directly puts the reader in his shoes as you choose from prompts and push the story forward. In a morbid kind of way, it is a ‘choose-your-own-adventure’ type piece of literature. 
I found this extremely effective, particularly how it all plays out in real time. You really are thrown into Hett’s point of view, and experience the fears, questions, ideas and recollections he had. His mind was likely racing and going back and forth, deciding what to do and how to process everything, so the experience feels very realistic as you click on actions and then are given the chance to go back and reconsider others, just like he would have done.
