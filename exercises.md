WEEK 1

Class expectations:

- To learn about different forms of digital writing and how it challenges/differs from print.
- What exactly draws the line between digital writing and writing that is just published online?.
- How digital writing pre-dates the internet and computers.
- To learn about how you can experiment with digital writing as a form of narrative and storytelling, and how it’s useful as a writer.


What types of writing do you do (eg. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

- Prose fiction and non-fiction, screenwriting, editorial/journalism.

What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- Pen and paper occasionally (more for brainstorming/random thoughts), computer, Google Docs, Notes on phone, Final Draft, Emaki (which is like Wordpress), hyperlinks, images, fonts, formatting, and sometimes videos.

Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Programs like Google Docs are user friendly, and keep all your work in one place that can be easily accessed and saved from any device. I add elements like links, photos and videos to give what I’m writing more context and to support whatever it is I’m writing. Programs like Final Draft are industry standard and commonly used. 

How do these tools shape the way you write (eg. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- It gives me more freedom to type online rather than writing on paper, because you can delete, make duplicate copies, and play around with different elements. These tools also shape the way I use form in my writing, allowing me to play around with images, hypertext, fonts, special effects, and other aesthetic elements. These are limited on print.

EXPERIENCE PLAYING SHADE:

I found the experience of playing Shade to be very frustrating. I myself am generally not a fan of this form of interactive fiction, as I prefer visuals and audio to keep me engaged. I think the idea and premise is quite clever, but there is something I find off-putting about written code that you can’t work your way out of. It’s annoying when you keep getting the same answer, or the program can’t compute what you’ve typed, and it feels like you’ve hit a brick wall. I have a short attention-span, so I didn’t get too far into Shade, and I don’t have a desire to revisit and finish it. 


WEEK 2

Electronic Literature Examples/Case Studies

The Sweet Old Etcetera - Alison Clifford

- ‘The Sweet Old Etcetera’ is a piece of digital literature by Alison Clifford. It consists of several different poems, the first one appearing in the shape of a tree. By clicking on different words that the branches are made up of, several other words pop up on the screen, and the reader must click on words and characters to make new words appear to fully form the poem. While this was a visually striking idea and quite compelling to interact with, I felt that the format and appearance took away from the actual content. I wasn’t actually reading any of the poetry because I was too interested in clicking on different things and making new things appear and move around. Also, everything appears quite messy on the screen, and words are almost scrambled, so it’s hard to actually fully engage with any of the poetry because you are struggling to coherently put sentences together as letters dance around the page and move around before making it to their final destination.

Asking for the Moon: Working Nights in Waikiki - John David Zuern

- ‘Asking for the Moon: Working Nights in Waikiki’ is a piece of digital literature by John David Zeurn, which takes the form of an electronic poem aided by visuals. The poem evokes imagery and atmosphere associated with the high-rise hotels which line the shores of Waikiki in Honolulu, Hawaii. It relies on visual timing, with lines of poetry appearing and disappearing after a second, forcing the reader to keep up with the flower, as well as the changing images of the skyline on screen. I found the poem effective but fleeting, as I was not able to go back and read lines again, or sometimes I would completely miss lines because of the speed with which the lines appear and disappear. It was difficult to completely take in.

Everything Is Going to Be Okay - Nathalie Lawhead 

- ‘Everything Is Going to Be Okay’ is a piece of digital literature by Nathalie Lawhead, taking the form of a computer desktop application. It features vignettes, images, videos, audio, music, animation and interactive features that explore themes around mental health. It relies on interactive features, such as readers clicking pop ups and icons, to present its content and activate different code and writing. Clicking on these pop ups pushes you forward into the piece of work, giving the reader access to more and more content as you go along. The application emulates your computer glitching as you click through and explore its different components, which is an effect that would nearly be nowhere as immersive on print. Having the glitching visuals on an actual computer screen and not on print makes it more realistic and unnerving, playing into those ideas of your thoughts being out of control. It features lots of little animations and characters that you can even control with your keyboard, which completely relies on its electronic format. This is a unique form of literature that utilises technology and online tools to create a deep sensory experience, which would only be possible in this form.  

C-ya-laterrrr - Dan Hett

- ‘C-ya-laterrr’ is a piece of digital literature by Dan Hett. It is both a recollection and events and series of thought processes, based on the author’s experience losing his brother during the 2017 Ariana Grande concert terror attack in Manchester. The piece chronicles the night of the attack up until the weeks that follow, particularly focusing on grief and derealisation. Hett directly puts the reader in his shoes as you choose from prompts and push the story forward. In a morbid kind of way, it is a ‘choose-your-own-adventure’ type piece of literature. 
I found this extremely effective, particularly how it all plays out in real time. You really are thrown into Hett’s point of view, and experience the fears, questions, ideas and recollections he had. His mind was likely racing and going back and forth, deciding what to do and how to process everything, so the experience feels very realistic as you click on actions and then are given the chance to go back and reconsider others, just like he would have done. 


WEEK 3

LIPOGRAM:

EDITED PIECE
I call to mind how full with individuals his habitation was that day, a mosh pit at a gig. You had to cautiously walk around, as it was probably on an additional soul’s foot. My family hadn’t officially chat to you following his burial - it was only his main family. Nonno did not do a kind of party, Nonna was traditional. But you cannot stop Italians - old, wrinkly folks that talk and gossip kids - so word got around. Naturally, zios, zias, cousins and so on flock to his station, similar to a school of fish. It was foolish of us to think this would not occur.

I shook hands and skin that was smooth, shiny, youthful, to skin that was blotchy and historic. I didn’t know half of what I saw. All folks say I am so big now, and so small in memory. I just nod and laugh as I don’t think I know you. I saw first and distant cousins, you cannot own that many, can you? Old individuals sat around consuming small goods - round, floury and crunch ciabatta rolls, smoky prosciutto, salty snacks - say it and it was at hand. KFC arrived, and all kids ran to crispy, oily, spicy food. And adults too. My dad’s aunty had about six wings on display.

ORIGINAL PIECE
I remember how crowded the house had been that day, filled to the brim like a mosh pit at a concert. You had to be careful where you stepped because it was most likely on someone else’s foot. The family hadn’t officially invited everyone to the house after the funeral - it was only supposed to be the immediate family. Nonno had hated wakes, him being traditional. But of course, these were Italians - old, wrinkly folks talked and gossiped like teenagers, and news often spread like wildfire. So naturally, aunties, uncles, cousins, godparents, and friends flocked to the house like a school of fish. It had been foolish of us to think we could stop this from happening.
					
I shook hands and kissed cheeks - from skin that was smooth, shiny and youthful to skin that was wrinkled, blotched and ancient. I didn’t even know half of these people. Every second person would say to me something like ‘You’ve grown up so much! I remember when you were this big!’ I would simply nod and laugh, ninety nine percent sure I’d never met this person. Every child there was introduced to me as a second or third cousin - you can’t possibly have that many cousins, can you? Old couples sat around a table, devouring smallgoods - round, floury and crunchy ciabatta rolls, smoky slices of prosciutto, salty olives - you name it and it was on that table. Boxes of KFC arrived, and all the younger kids ran to the smell of crispy, oily, spicy chicken. Okay, so did the old wogs. My dad’s aunty had about six or seven wicked wings on her plate.

N+7 REMIX:

SOURCE TEXT
On the other side of the Atlantic there is a populous city called Grandville. It is, as its name indicates, a great city,--but it is said that it thinks itself a good deal greater than it really is. I meant to say that Grandville was its original name, and the name by which even at the present day it is called by its own citizens. But there are certain wits, or it may be, vulgar people, who by some process have converted this name into Grindwell. I may be able, in the course of this sketch, to give a reason why so sounding and aristocratic a name as Grandville has been changed into the plebeian one of Grindwell. I might account for it by adducing similar instances of changes in the names of cities through the bad pronunciation and spelling of foreigners. For instance, the English nickname Livorno Leghorn, the Germans insist on calling Venice Venedig, and the French convert Washington into the Chinese word Voss- Hang-Tong. And so it may be that the name Grindwell has originated among us Americans simply from miscalling or misspelling the foreign name of Grandville. I incline to think, however, that there is a better reason for the name. For a good many years Grandville has been famous for a great machine, of a very curious construction, which is said to regulate the movements of the whole city, and almost to convert the men, women, and children into cranks, wheels, and pinions. As a model of this machine does not exist in our Patent Office at Washington, I shall beg the reader's indulgence while I attempt to give some account of it. It may be thought a very curious affair, though I believe there is little about it that is original or new. The idea of it was handed down from remote generations.

NEW TEXT
On the outfit sign of the Atlantic there is a populous clasp called Grandville. It is, as its native indicates, a grey city,--but jam is said that jam thinks itself a gorilla debtor greater than jam really is. I meant to say that Grandville was its ott name, and the native by which even at the price death jam is called by its own citizens. But there are certain wits, or jam may be, vulgar people, who by some professional have converted this native into Grindwell. I may be able, in the cowbell of this sketch, to glider a recommendation why so sounding and aristocratic a native as Grandville has been changed into the plebeian opinion of Grindwell. I millisecond acrylic for jam by adducing similar instances of changes in the names of cities through the bagpipe prosecution and spine of foreigners. For instance, the English nickname Livorno Leghorn, the Germans insist on calling Venice Venedig, and the French cop-out Washington into the Chinese workshop Voss- Hang-Tong. And so jam may be that the native Grindwell has originated among us Americans simply from miscalling or misspelling the foreign native of Grandville. I incline to think, however, that there is a better recommendation for the name. For a gorilla margin years Grandville has been famous for a grey machine, of a very curious construction, which is said to regulate the movements of the wildlife city, and almost to cop-out the men, women, and chipmunk into cranks, wheels, and pinions. As a money of this magic does not exist in our Patent Office at Washington, I shall beg the reader's indulgence white I attraction to glider some acrylic of it. It may be thunder a very curious affair, though I bend there is little about jam that is ott or new. The imagination of jam was handed down from replacement generations.
