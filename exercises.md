WEEK 1

Class expectations:

- To learn about different forms of digital writing and how it challenges/differs from print.
- What exactly draws the line between digital writing and writing that is just published online?.
- How digital writing pre-dates the internet and computers.
- To learn about how you can experiment with digital writing as a form of narrative and storytelling, and how it’s useful as a writer.


What types of writing do you do (eg. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

- Prose fiction and non-fiction, screenwriting, editorial/journalism.

What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- Pen and paper occasionally (more for brainstorming/random thoughts), computer, Google Docs, Notes on phone, Final Draft, Emaki (which is like Wordpress), hyperlinks, images, fonts, formatting, and sometimes videos.

Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Programs like Google Docs are user friendly, and keep all your work in one place that can be easily accessed and saved from any device. I add elements like links, photos and videos to give what I’m writing more context and to support whatever it is I’m writing. Programs like Final Draft are industry standard and commonly used. 

How do these tools shape the way you write (eg. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- It gives me more freedom to type online rather than writing on paper, because you can delete, make duplicate copies, and play around with different elements. These tools also shape the way I use form in my writing, allowing me to play around with images, hypertext, fonts, special effects, and other aesthetic elements. These are limited on print.

EXPERIENCE PLAYING SHADE:

I found the experience of playing Shade to be very frustrating. I myself am generally not a fan of this form of interactive fiction, as I prefer visuals and audio to keep me engaged. I think the idea and premise is quite clever, but there is something I find off-putting about written code that you can’t work your way out of. It’s annoying when you keep getting the same answer, or the program can’t compute what you’ve typed, and it feels like you’ve hit a brick wall. I have a short attention-span, so I didn’t get too far into Shade, and I don’t have a desire to revisit and finish it.
